CRUSH
-----

Crush or be Crushed!

A simple 2D game where the main objective is to crush all of the bad guys either by jumping on them
or by squishing them between two blocks, withouth getting crushed yourself. Special bonuses are 
awarded for collecting all of the time limited items which appear in the map.


CRUSH is written in C++1y and requires a modern compiler, such as Visual Studio 2013 or clang/llvm

CRUSH depends on SFML 2.x, and is developed using the latest snapshots as they are available. The
CRUSH repository contains a Visual Studio solution, and a CMake file which should provide a good
starting point for various Linuces. CRUSH is released under the zlib license, as it appears in the
source code. Contributions are welcome, particularly when adding platform support to the CMake file.
